# AgePrediction

The provided code encompasses a comprehensive approach to training and evaluating deep learning models for age prediction from images using DenseNet, VGG, and ResNet architectures. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of each part:

# Libraries and Dependencies
Keras and TensorFlow: Essential for loading and preprocessing images, defining and training models, and visualizing results.
Matplotlib and NumPy: Utilized for plotting results and manipulating arrays.
PIL: Used for image processing.

# Utility Functions
### predict_and_plot:

Loads and preprocesses an image.
Predicts the age using the trained model.
Denormalizes the predicted age.
Plots the image with the predicted age.
### plot_label_distribution:

Plots the distribution of labels (ages) in the dataset.
Converts normalized labels back to their original values for visualization.
plot_model_structure:

Saves and displays the structure of the model as a PNG image.
### plot_training_history:

Plots the training and validation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) over epochs.
plot_real_vs_predicted:

Plots the real vs. predicted values for the test dataset.
# Data Preparation
Loading Images: Images are loaded from a specified directory, resized, and converted to arrays.
Labels Extraction: Labels (ages) are extracted from the folder names and converted to numeric values.
Normalization: Labels are normalized to a range of 0 to 1.
Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80%-20%).
